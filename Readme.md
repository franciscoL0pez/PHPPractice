## ðŸ“Œ Proposed Solution
This project is a **web application** built using **Laravel** and **TailwindCSS**, focused on providing a simple user **registration and login** system, along with basic **CRUD operations** for managing user data.

The solution implements server-side rendering through Blade templates and styling through TailwindCSS. The application connects to a **MySQL** database for storing and managing user information.

Routing, validation, session management, and error handling are managed using Laravelâ€™s built-in features. No Docker or external API tools like Postman were used, as all interactions are through web forms.
